Breast cancer is a malignant tumor that forms in the cells of the breast. It can occur in both men and women but is more common in women. Early detection through regular screenings, such as mammograms, increases treatment success. Common symptoms include lumps, changes in breast size or shape, and skin changes. Risk factors include age, genetics, hormonal influences, and lifestyle. Treatment options vary and may include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapy. Awareness, education, and support play crucial roles in the fight against breast cancer, emphasizing the importance of self-exams and proactive healthcare practices.
